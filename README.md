# Ruzuku coding guidelines

This repo represents some guidelines/suggestions for contributing to the
Ruzuku codebase. Much of this is nothing more than suggestion, and we don't
strictly enforce the rules.

That said, deviations should be made only with good reason. If any rules are
causing problems, we should change the rules.
